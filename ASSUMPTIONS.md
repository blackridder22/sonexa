# Assumptions

This document lists the assumptions and choices made during the development of Sonexa.

- **Package Manager:** `npm` will be used for package management.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS will be used for styling.
- **Component Library:** No component library like shadcn/ui will be used for now to keep it simple, but can be added later.
